# TLS Playground Project

This TLS Playground (TP) demonstrates various TLS scenarios, including certificate handling and client/server interactions over TLS.



## TP Components

The TP consist of several loosely related components.
These can all be controlled with the **[TP CLI Tool](bin/README.md)**.

### Certificate Utilities

Utilities for dealing with [CSRs and self-signed X.509 certificates](cert/README.md) using *OpenSSL*.

### Demo CAs

Configuration samples and utilities for running private [Certificate Authorities (CA)](ca/README.md) and signing certificates with it.

### ACME Utilities

Configuration samples and utilities for ordering certificates with the [ACME](acme/README.md) protocol using *Certbot* and *Let's Encrypt*.

### Demo Servers

Demo [web servers](server/README.md) using various configurations and certificates.

### Demo Clients

Demo [clients](client/README.md) using various configurations and certificates.



## Using TP Locally

You should be able to run TP on any Unixy operating system, including Linux and Mac OS.
If you're using Windows or some other unsupported OS, consider running TP in a Linux VM.
Or, run TP in a Docker container, as described in the next section.

If you plan to use TP to order X.509 certificates from a public Certificate Authority (CA), it's best to run TP on an Internet-facing host with a public DNS record.
Even then, you can run TP on a host in a private network or even fully offline.
You'll just have to do some steps manually, see the [TP ACME utilities](acme/README.md) for details.

When running TP locally, you'll need to install the following prerequisites (tested versions in parentheses):

* **[GNU Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)** (5.2.15)
* Assorted **Unix utilities**:
  `awk`, `basename`, `cat`, `chmod`, `cp`, `dd`, `dirname`, `envsubst`, `find`, `getopt`, `grep`, `id`, `ln`, `mkdir`, `printf`, `rm`, `sed`, `shred`, `sort`, `touch`, `tr`, `true`, `xargs`
  (Tested with recent versions from the [GNU](https://www.gnu.org/software/software.html) project.
  Note: TP is incompatible with `getopt` implementations based on non-GNU libraries, which may cause trouble on BSD-ish Unix systems, incl. Mac OS. In the latter, this can be fixed by installing the [`gnu-getopt`](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/gnu-getopt) package through [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).)
* **[OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/)** (3.0.10)
* **[Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/)** (2.1.0)
* [nginx](https://nginx.org/) (1.24.0)
* Java, e.g. [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.org/) (17.0.9-ea)



## Using TP with Docker

### Building a TP Docker Image

Use the following to create a Docker image with the TLS Playground and all its prerequisites.
And upload it to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/), assuming your Docker Hub user account name is stored in environment variable `${DOCKER_HUB_USER}`.
Just execute these three commands:

```
docker image pull debian:testing-slim
```
```
docker build --tag "${DOCKER_HUB_USER}/tls-playground:latest" .
```
```
docker image push "${DOCKER_HUB_USER}/tls-playground:latest"
```

You may also find a pre-built TLS Playground image at [meeque/tls-playground:latest](https://hub.docker.com/r/meeque/tls-playground), but no guarantees that it's actually based on the latest sources.

### Running with Docker

The TP Docker image does **not** follow best practices for minimal containers and dedicated containers per application.
Since it is meant for easy exploration and learning rather than for productive use, TP bundles all functionality into a single Docker image.
Users are expected to run a shell inside the container and execute TP CLI commands manually.

For example, when using a [TP Demo Server](server/README.md) together with the [TP ACME Utilities](acme/README.md), both the ACME challenges server and the demo server will run inside the same container side-by-side.
And so will short-lived *OpenSSL* and *Certbot* commands.

Moreover, the TP Docker container will accumulate application state, such as private keys and certificates.
Therefore, it is preferable to create the container once and reuse it for all TLS Playground exploration.
You can do so with the following command:

```
docker container create \
  --name 'tls-playground' \
  --env 'TP_SERVER_DOMAIN=tls-playground.example' \
  --env 'TP_SERVER_LISTEN_ADDRESS=*' \
  --env 'TP_ACME_SERVER_URL=lets-encrypt-staging' \
  --publish '0.0.0.0:80:8080' \
  --publish '0.0.0.0:443:8443' \
  "${DOCKER_HUB_USER}/tls-playground:latest" -c 'sleep infinity'
```

Though you may want to replace `tls-playground.example` in the above with your own domain name.
Or omit the `TP_SERVER_DOMAIN` env-var altogether, if you do not want to use TP with an ACME CA.
See the [TP CLI](bin/README.md) documentation for other supported environment variables.

Once you have configured the TP Docker container, you can start it with this command:

```
docker container start tls-playground
```

As mentioned above, the container won't do much after you've started it.
It will just sit there and wait.
You can than run a shell in the TP Docker container and start using the [TP CLI](bin/README.md) interactively using the built-in bash shell:

```
sudo docker container exec --tty --interactive tls-playground bash
```

By default, the shell inside the container displays `[TP]` in the prompt.
Once you `exit` the shell in the TP Docker container, you should fall back to your regular shell outside the container.

However, the container will keep running, including a TP demo server that you may have started in the container.
Once you do not need the TLS Playground anymore, you can stop the TP Docker container with the following command:

```
docker container stop tls-playground
```

### Developing with Docker

The TP Docker image and container described in the last two sections will not contain any Git repository information.
Even when you've created the Docker image based on a local clone of the [official TP Git repo](https://github.com/meeque/tls-playground/) or your own fork of the same.
This is because of the default Docker ignores that come with the TLS Playground.
Besides, the TP Docker image does not contain any Git client by design and does not encourage exposing Git server credentials into a TP Docker container.

If you want to develop changes to the TLS Playground yourself (e.g. adjust CSR config files) it is recommended that you do this directly on the underlying Docker host.
You can still run TP CLI commands in a Docker container though.
The easiest way to achieve this is a [Docker bind-mount](https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/).
For example, when you have cloned the TP Git repository into the current working directory, you can use the following `--mount` option to create the TP Docker container:

```
docker container create \
  --name 'tls-playground' \
  --env 'TP_SERVER_DOMAIN=tls-playground.example' \
  --env 'TP_SERVER_LISTEN_ADDRESS=*' \
  --env 'TP_ACME_SERVER_URL=lets-encrypt-staging' \
  --publish '0.0.0.0:80:8080' \
  --publish '0.0.0.0:443:8443' \
  --mount 'type=bind,source=.,target=/opt/tls-playground' \
  "${DOCKER_HUB_USER}/tls-playground:latest" -c 'sleep infinity'
```

See the previous section for information on the other container creation options, and on running and using the resulting TP Docker container.

Note that code running inside this TP Docker container will have full access to bind-mounted portion of your local file-system.
If you do not trust the TP Docker image at all, you should consider using a [Docker volume](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) rather than a bind-mount.
You can then attach the Docker volume to different container that can perform the necessary Git operations.
