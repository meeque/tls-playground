# TLS Playground Java Client

This TLS Playground component helps you with configuring Java TLS clients. This includes configuration of certificate revocation checks and client certificates. The latter is useful when accessing [TP demo server `nginx-complex`](../../server/nginx-complex/).



## General Configuration

This client supports making HTTPS GET requests to arbitrary URLs. Specify one or more URLs in non-option arguments.

Use option arguments (those in the form `--foo=bar`) to control the TLS configuration. The client is implemented in Spring Boot, for supported configuration options see the [TlsProperties](src/main/java/de/meeque/play/tlsplayground/client/tls/TlsProperties.java) file.

Usage examples:

```
# HTTPS request with default TLS configuration
java -jar 'target/tls-playground-client-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar' 'https://en.wikipedia.org/' 

# 2 HTTPS requests with default TLS configuration
java -jar 'target/tls-playground-client-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar' 'https://badssl.com/' 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security'
```



## PKIX Certificate Revocation Checks (Programmatically)

By default, Java TLS clients using a standard `SSLContext` do not seem to perform certificate revocation checks according to the PKIX standard. This may differ among JVM versions and vendors though.

This Java client supports boolean configuration option `--tls.check-revocation` to explicitly enable certificate revocation with `java.security.cert.PKIXRevocationChecker`. It also supports optional configuration option `--tls.pkix-revocation-checker-options` which takes a comma-separated list of the enum values of `PKIXRevocationChecker.Option`.

Usage examples:

```
# HTTPS request to a server with a revoked certificate.
# Using default TLS configuration.
# This request is expected to succeed, since the default configuration does not perform revocation checks.
java -jar 'target/tls-playground-client-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar' 'https://revoked.badssl.com/'

# HTTP request to a server with a revoked certificate.
# Using a custom Java `SSLContext` with PKIX revocation checks.
# This is expected to fail and print a Java Exception that indicates that the certificate has been revoked.
java -jar 'target/tls-playground-client-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar' --tls.check-revocation='true' 'https://revoked.badssl.com/'

# HTTP request to a server with a revoked certificate.
# Using a custom Java `SSLContext` with custom PKIX revocation checker options:
# - NO_FALLBACK: no fallback from OCSP to CRL.
# - SOFT_FAIL: no failure, when OCSP responder is not reachable.
java -jar 'target/tls-playground-client-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar' --tls.check-revocation='true' --tls.pkix-revocation-checker-options='NO_FALLBACK,SOFT_FAIL' 'https://revoked.badssl.com/'
```



## PKIX Certificate Revocation Checks (via JVM Configuration)

Alternatively, some JSSE providers can be configured to perform revocation checks. This may be provider-dependent, but it seems to work with the default provider configuration comming with most JDK flavors.

Certificate revocation checks with OCSP can be configured via a combination of *Java System Properties* and *Java Security Properties*. The latter can be set programmatically, or by an additional configuration properties file, e.g. [this one](config/jvm/java.security).

The recommended configuration for OCSP is:
* System property:
  ```
  com.sun.net.ssl.checkRevocation=true
  ```
* Security property:
  ```
  ocsp.enable=true
  ```

Usage example:
```
# HTTP request to a server with a revoked certificate.
# Using a default Java `SSLContext` with appropriate Java configuration properties.
# This is expected to fail and print a Java Exception that indicates that the certificate has been revoked.
java -Dcom.sun.net.ssl.checkRevocation=true -Djava.security.properties=config/jvm/java.security -jar 'target/tls-playground-client-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar' 'https://revoked.badssl.com/'
```



## Client Certificates

**TODO** Document how to use the `--tls.client-cert` and `--tls.client-key` configuration options.
